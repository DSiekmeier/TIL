# Git: Show a pretty graphical log

Viewing the structure of a repository with all its branches is often helpful when working on larger projects. Even in the terminal it is possible to view a graphical representation of it.

```bash
git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
```

**Note:** The options form the nice little mnemonic "`a Dog`".
